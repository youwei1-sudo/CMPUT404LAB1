Question 5: What status code is returned for http://google.com ? What URL must you visit to get a 200 status code?

It is returned 301 moved status code,
We must changed URL to the  https://www.google.com/

Question6: What status code is returned for http://google.com/teapot?Is it the one returned by curl -i or curl -iL? What happens when you curl http://www.google.com/teapot?

Status code retured for  http://google.com/teapot is 418,  
It is the same Status code  with returned by curl -i and curl -iL, But the curl -i will include the HTTP response headers in the output, And Curl -iL 's L part (HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that the requested page  has  moved  to  a  different  location this option will make curl redo the request on the new place. If used together with -i, --include or  -I,  --head,  headers  from  all requested pages will be shown. When authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials to the initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it won't  be  able  to  intercept  the user+password.  
When using curl http://www.google.com/teapot? The HTTP 418 I'm a teapot client error response code indicates that the server refuses to brew coffee because it is, permanently, a teapot. A combined coffee/tea pot that is temporarily out of coffee should instead return 503. This error is a reference to Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol defined in April Fools' jokes in 1998 and 2014

Question7 :What changed in the output of https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hindle1/1.py when you used -X POST? What is this method useful for?

When using -X post, request method showed as <DT> REQUEST_METHOD <DD> POST, instead of GET. And there are an UNIQUE ID and REMOTE PORT difference, At their two responses. ex.

<DT> UNIQUE_ID <DD> X-0JvUjVHjVj1nzfTTww2QAAAAw

<DT> UNIQUE_ID <DD> X-0J98SiKs9sDMaR6OggnwAAAAI

The -X POST uses for specifing the custom request method(POST) to use when communicating with the HTTP server. The specified request method (POST) will be used instead of the method otherwise used (which defaults to GET). That is why we get different result.  Both GET and POST method is used to transfer data from client to server in HTTP protocol but Main difference between POST and GET method is that GET carries request parameter appended in URL string while POST carries request parameter in message body which makes it more secure way of transferring data from client to server in http protocol.
